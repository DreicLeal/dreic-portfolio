        After roughly 10 years working in a bank, I developed essential skills
        for working in groups and on the dynamics of working in a large company,
        and I am very grateful for that, but I understood which that job didnâ€™t
        awaken me to the best that I could deliver in all terms from creativity
        to pure performance.

        I took a break on my career and went looking for
        what I really wanted to accomplish in life, I always wanted to create
        and build, which led me back to what I studied in high school: IT.
